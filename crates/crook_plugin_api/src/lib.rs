//! What a sandboxed plugin and its host say to each other.
//!
//! Shared by both sides: the host links this crate, and so does every plugin
//! compiled to wasm. That is the whole reason it exists — a wire format
//! written down twice is a wire format that will disagree with itself.
//!
//! # It describes, it does not paint
//!
//! Nothing here is a colour, a pixel or a font. A [`Node`] says *what a thing
//! is* — a label, a badge, a row — and the host decides what that looks like
//! in the theme that happens to be in force. That is the line between the two
//! tiers, and it is what makes a sandboxed plugin survive a theme it has never
//! heard of, a display scale it was not written for, and a version of Crook
//! that draws badges differently.
//!
//! A native plugin gets `&mut PaintContext` and can do anything. This tier
//! cannot, and the question "does it need a `PaintContext`?" is exactly how a
//! feature is sorted into one tier or the other. See `docs/plugins.md`.
//!
//! # Versioned by one number
//!
//! [`ABI_VERSION`] is the whole compatibility story. A plugin says which
//! version it was built against and the host refuses anything it does not
//! know, by name, with a line a person can act on — rather than decoding a
//! shape that means something else now and drawing nonsense.
//!
//! The rule for changing this vocabulary is the one `docs/plugins.md` states:
//! **add a slot, never widen the vocabulary**. A new [`Node`] variant is a new
//! ABI version and a migration for everybody; a new slot is neither.
