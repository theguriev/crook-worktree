//! What a sandboxed plugin and its host say to each other.
//!
//! Shared by both sides: the host links this crate, and so does every plugin
//! compiled to wasm. That is the whole reason it exists — a wire format
//! written down twice is a wire format that will disagree with itself.
//!
//! # It describes, it does not paint
//!
//! Nothing here is a colour, a pixel or a font. A [`Node`] says *what a thing
//! is* — a label, a badge, a row — and the host decides what that looks like
//! in the theme that happens to be in force. That is the line between the two
//! tiers, and it is what makes a sandboxed plugin survive a theme it has never
//! heard of, a display scale it was not written for, and a version of Crook
//! that draws badges differently.
//!
//! A native plugin gets `&mut PaintContext` and can do anything. This tier
//! cannot, and the question "does it need a `PaintContext`?" is exactly how a
//! feature is sorted into one tier or the other. See `docs/plugins.md`.
//!
//! # Versioned by one number
//!
//! [`ABI_VERSION`] is the whole compatibility story. A plugin says which
//! version it was built against and the host refuses anything it does not
//! know, by name, with a line a person can act on — rather than decoding a
//! shape that means something else now and drawing nonsense.
//!
//! The rule for changing this vocabulary is the one `docs/plugins.md` states:
//! **add a slot, never widen the vocabulary**. A new [`Node`] variant is a new
//! ABI version and a migration for everybody; a new slot is neither.

/// What version of this vocabulary a plugin was built against.
///
/// Bumped when a shape below changes in a way that would make an older plugin
/// decode to something other than what it meant. Adding a variant to an enum
/// counts: postcard encodes a variant by its index, so an older host reading a
/// newer plugin's `Node` would read the wrong variant rather than fail.
///
/// **8** is the version a plugin can hear a **bell** in. A shell marks where a
/// command ended and Crook cuts a block at the mark, but a program that holds
/// the terminal for an hour — an agent, a REPL, anything a person talks to —
/// ends nothing the shell can see, and rings BEL instead when it wants them
/// back. [`Event::Bell`] is that ring and [`Capability::WatchBells`] is what a
/// person grants to hear it, which together are the difference between "ring
/// when my build finishes" and "ring when the thing I am talking to has
/// stopped talking".
///
/// **7** is the version a plugin can act on **one command** in.
/// [`Subject::Block`], which is what a render of a slot in a block's menu is
/// about — the command line, how it ended and where it ran, each redacted
/// against what a person granted, exactly as a tab row's facts are.
/// [`Capability::ReadBlock`] is what un-redacts it, and
/// [`Request::Output`] is the half a subject cannot afford to carry: what the
/// command *printed* can be a megabyte, and a subject is built on every frame
/// a menu is open, so the output is asked for once when an entry runs rather
/// than copied sixty times a second at somebody who may never press anything.
/// [`Request::Copy`] is the other addition, and the shortest way for a plugin
/// to hand a person what it worked out.
///
/// **6** gave a plugin a field the keyboard can be in, and a menu on a
/// secondary click.
///
/// **5** is the version a plugin can be *noticed* in.
/// [`Capability::PlaySound`] and [`Capability::WatchCommands`], which together
/// are a plugin that can ring when a command finishes; the
/// [`Request::PlaySound`] that carries the audio itself rather than a path;
/// [`Event`], the first thing the host says to a plugin that the plugin did
/// not ask for; and [`Node::Explained`], which lets one hang what it would
/// otherwise have to say permanently off the thing it is about.
///
/// **4** is the version a plugin can be asked the same question twice in. A
/// render used to carry a slot name and nothing else, which is enough for a
/// slot there is one of — the header has one right-hand end — and nothing at
/// all for a slot that is drawn once per row of a list. So a render carries a
/// [`Render`]: the slot, and the [`Subject`] it is about when the slot has
/// one. What a subject *says* is [`redacted`](TabFacts) against what a person
/// granted, which is why a plugin that marks every tab with a picture of its
/// own can be a plugin allowed to know nothing about any of them.
///
/// **3** added [`Request::Tally`] and the `/**` a granted path may end in: a
/// plugin can have a directory of line-delimited JSON counted for it without
/// any of it crossing the boundary. A hundred megabytes of transcripts is a
/// hundred megabytes wherever it is read; what a sandbox cannot afford is
/// carrying it *through*, or looking at it a line at a time. So it does
/// neither, and every decision about what the counting *means* — which lines
/// are one line, what to group by, what to add up — stays with the plugin,
/// which supplies each of them as a field name.
///
/// **2** is the version a plugin can *do* something in. One added
/// [`Capability`] ([`Capability::ReadFiles`]), the [`Request`]/[`Answer`] pair
/// that lets a plugin ask the host to reach the network or read a file on its
/// behalf, and the six [`Node`] variants a panel needs. Version 1 could
/// describe a badge and register an action, which is a plugin that can say
